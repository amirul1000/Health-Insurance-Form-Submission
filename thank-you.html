  <h2>Terms And Conditions Of Use</h2>
  <p>Last Revised 11/21/2008</p>
  <p>By using or accessing Healthinsure.com (the "Site"),   or any of the Site's Content (as defined below),  you acknowledge that   you agree to and are subject to the following terms and conditions (the "Terms").   If you do not fully agree to these Terms, you may not access or   otherwise use the Site. You should read through all the Terms carefully.   The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and All   Web Leads, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is the owner of the Site ("AWL", "us" or "our").   You covenant, represent and warrant that you have any and all   authorizations as may be necessary to enter into this agreement and that   your use of the Site, including provision or use of any Content,  does   not violate any applicable law.</p>
  <p>1. Our Services. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ANY INSURANCE OR OTHER TRANSACTION.   We do not offer or sell any insurance or other products described on   the Site. Instead, the Site acts as a venue to allow insurance   companies, insurance agents and other parties who are customers of our   Site (each, a "Provider") to offer for sale   and sell, in a variety of formats, insurance and other authorized   products to potential consumers (each, a "Prospect", and all Prospects and Providers are collectively called the Site&rsquo;s "users")   who have visited one of our affiliated sites and applied to receive   insurance or other authorized quotations from a Provider (the "Service").   We are not involved in the actual transaction between any Prospect and   any Provider even though we may, through our affiliate sites, and with   each Prospect&rsquo;s authorization, collect certain information   (collectively, a "Lead") about any Prospect   and sell such Lead to a Provider. As a result, the quality, safety or   legality of the products offered by any Provider for sale, the truth or   accuracy of the representations regarding such products, the ability of   Providers to offer or sell such products or the ability of Prospects to   pay for the products offered are solely the responsibility of each user.   We are an independent contractor for all purposes.  Importantly, we do   not issue insurance contracts or bind coverage. We are not responsible   in any way for the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. We do not   endorse or recommend any companies or insurance policies. We do not   provide insurance, tax, legal or any other financial advice. We do not   guarantee that any of the Providers to whom we forward any Prospect's   application will contact such Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect   with the desired coverage. If you are a Prospect and you would like   personal advice or specific policy recommendations, please consult with   an insurance agent, broker or other qualified professional.</p>
  <p>2. Personal Use. Although   we do charge a fee to Providers to purchase Leads, and we may from   time-to-time charge users fees for utilizing various other services that   may now or in the future be provided by our Site, we do not charge   users to access the public portions of our Site. Accordingly, we grant   each user a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access the Site   in order to, as applicable, view or make legitimate inquiries to us   regarding our Service, all in accordance with these Terms. We further   grant each Provider a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to   access the password-protected portions of the Site in accordance with   these Terms and any written agreement between us and the Provider. Any   other use of the Site is expressly prohibited. Importantly, this limited   license does not include any right of collection, aggregation, copying,   duplication, display or derivative use of the Site nor any right of use   of data mining, robots, spiders or similar data gathering and   extraction tools without our prior written permission; provided,   however, that a limited exception from the foregoing exclusion is   provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial   public archives that use tools to gather information for the sole   purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Site, provided that they each do   so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily   identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file.</p>

  <h3>Information transfer and sharing policy</h3>
  <p><strong>Generally. </strong>When you begin to provide   personally identifiable information to us, you do so for the purpose of   our sharing this information with Providers to                       provide you with the quotes you requested, and this   information then becomes subject to each Provider's own privacy policy   (if any). Federal and state laws provide limitations                       on the information practices of financial   institutions such as insurance companies. Providers and others to whom   we may forward your personally identifiable information may contact                       you with a quote by email, telephone, postal mail,   or other forms of communication as permitted by law and you agree to   receive such contacts when you submit your information,                       regardless of the presence of your phone number(s)   on any local or national no-call or similar no solicitation list. Except   as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share                       personally identifiable information collected from   you on this website with third parties for their direct marketing   purposes. Please understand that because we are in the business                       of helping consumers and Providers identify one   another, if you are a consumer and you do not permit us to share your   personally identifiable information with a Provider, we will be                       unable to assist you and some of our services and   offerings will be unavailable to you. We expect our Providers to whom we   forward your information to follow applicable laws and                       abide by the restrictions we impose on their use of   your personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p><strong>Other Usage and Offerings.</strong> As our   business grows, from time to time we may seek to make available   additional offerings and services including those that may not be   insurance-related. In doing so, we will strive to give our users choices   about whether or not you would like to continue to receive future   promotional or marketing communications from us either directly or on   behalf of others whose offerings we think may be of interest to you. In   identifying which offerings we think may be of interest to you, we may   use and analyze information you have provided to us. If you choose not   to receive such marketing communications, you may still receive certain   relationship or transactional communications from us as described   herein. We do not plan to sell, rent or transfer your personally   identifiable information for non-insurance related purposes to any third   parties unless or except in connection with the merger, sale or   reorganization of our business as set forth elsewhere in this policy.</p>
  <p><strong>Vendors and Suppliers.</strong> We may   provide personally identifiable information to or permit access to   personally identifiable information by our subsidiaries, affiliated   companies, vendors and service providers for the purpose of verifying   data or where such access is incidental to their assisting us such as   phone number verification services and email service providers. We   expect that these parties will only process such information based on   our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any   other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
  <p><strong>Protecting Our Legal Rights and Other's Rights.</strong> We do not otherwise share personally identifiable information about   website users with third parties unless we believe using or sharing such   information is appropriate to carry out a user's request or if we have a   good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such   information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,   regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b)   enforce our <a href="#">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>,   including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,   prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d)   protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of the   Company, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally   identifiable information as required by law or when we believe that   disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a legal   or judicial proceeding or court order.</p>
  <p><strong>Merger or Sale of Company.</strong> If we   should ever file for bankruptcy or have our assets sold to or merged   with another entity, information that we receive from you through this   website may be treated as an asset of the Company and may be transferred   to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
  <p><strong>Promotions and Programs.</strong> From time   to time, you may be given the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes,   contests, giveaways, or other promotions and programs offered by us,   either alone or with promotional partners. Participation in these   promotions or programs may require you to submit additional information   about yourself, including personally identifiable information.
